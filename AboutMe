ABOUT ME

Experience

    After working six dedicated years as a celebrity wardrobe stylist I craved a career change that would allow me to tap into my art background from USC and create a pathway to practice and survive in the digial era. 
    With this initative in hand I recenly graduated from a Front End Web Development course at General Assemnly with the intention of starting my own digital media company and creative consulting business. 
    Aside from my lucrative career in the fashion industry, my personal blog "From Dusk to Palms" has allowed me to develop and hone valuable skills for the social spectrum such as brand awareness, content production and SEO marketing.
